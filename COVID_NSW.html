    <h3 id="all"><i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> estimate from all cases</h3>

    <p>
      New South Wales is currently experiencing an outbreak of COVID, due to the delta
      variant. On June 26th, after a concerning increase in case numbers, the Greater
      Sydney area was placed under lockdown restrictions, and other restrictions were
      imposed in regional New South Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      How have New South Wales' restrictions affected the spread of the virus? The below
      plot shows how the effective reproduction number of the virus,
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has changed over time in New South Wales, as well as how
      the daily cases have changed over time. A trendline shows the approximate
      trajectory daily case numbers would follow, were the reproduction number of the
      virus to remain at its current level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plot is shown twice, the first with cases on a linear scale, and the
      second on a log scale—the latter showing how consistently the caseload has
      followed exponential growth (which forms a straight line on a log scale).
    </p>
    <img src="COVID_NSW_linear.svg">
    <img src="COVID_NSW.svg">

<!--     <h3 id="noniso"><i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> estimate from non-isolating cases only</h3>
    <p>
      Cases isolating during their infectious period represent a much lower risk of spread.
      The growth rate of non-isolating cases represents a more leading indicator of whether
      NSW is successfully suppressing the outbreak. The below plot is identical to the above
      one, except it excludes cases that were known to be isolating for their full infectious
      period.
    </p>
    <img src="COVID_NSW_noniso.svg"> -->

    <h3 id="vax">Projected effect of vaccine rollout</h3>
    <p>
      The trendline in the above plot simply projects forward case numbers assuming that
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current estimated value. What about the effect
      of vaccines? Below is a plot with the projected trend taking into account an
      estimated reduction of spread due to vaccination levels increasing in New South
      Wales through the remainder of the year. This projection is a stochastic SIR model,
      and thus also takes into account immunity due to infections, which would decrease
      transmission once a non-neglibible fraction of the population has been infected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of vaccination assumed in the model is 1.4 doses per 100 population per
      day in August, 1.6 doses per 100 population per day in September, and 1.8 doses
      per 100 population per day from October onward, up to a maximum of 85% of the
      population. See below for plots of how these assumed rates compare to the
      vaccination rollout in New South Wales so far. The vaccines are assumed to reduce
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> by 40% per dose per capita—that is, overall spread is
      reduced by 40% for a partly-vaccinated individual and 80% for a fully vaccinated
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      This projection shows what might be possible if all other factors affecting
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>—such as restrictions—are held constant. If New South Wales
      eases restrictions, however, then <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> will likely increase and
      the effect of vaccines in reducing spread will be delayed compared to this
      projection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plot is shown twice, the first with cases on a linear scale, and the
      second on a log scale.

      Below are plots of the vaccination rollout in New South Wales to date, in terms of
      daily and cumulative doses per 100 population, with the assumed future rate used
      for the above projections also shown.

    <h3 id="animated">Animated projections over time</h3>

    How have the above projections changed over time? Below are animated versions of the
    above projection, one with cases on a linear scale, and one with cases on a log
    scale, run on old data to show how the projections have changed over time. Note that
    these are not 100% identical to the projections actually made on previous days, as
    there have been some slight methodology changes - but they should be very close.

    <h3 id="regions"><i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> in the Hunter, Illawarra, and Western NSW regions</h3>

    <p>

      At time of writing, the Hunter region, Illawarra region, and Western New South
      Wales have notable growth in cases, even though cases are declining elsewhere in
      New South Wales. Below are plots showing an estimate of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> in
      each region, as well as case numbers and a trendine on a log scale.

    <h3 id="bipartite">Projected effect of vaccines with LGAs of concern treated separately</h3>

    <p>
    The above projection of the effect of the vaccine rollout in New South Wales is very
    simplistic. Because it treats the entire state as a single outbreak with a single
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>, it can't accurately describe the substantially different
    rate of spread within the LGAs of concern, compared to the rest of New South Wales.
    In reality, the outbreaks in these two different settings have different
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> values and may peak at different times. Below is a projection
    that treats the two outbreaks separately, projecting each forward based in its
    current <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and the same vaccination model, and then adds the
    results together to show a projection of statewide case numbers. The result should
    be more realistic than treating the entire state as a single outbreak. This
    projection does, however, still use statewide vaccination numbers, and would be
    improved if that were further broken down by LGA (It's on my todo list!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the data used for this projection lags the statewide numbers by up to
      several days due to the delay in New South Wales Health publishing LGA breakdowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plot is shown twice, first with cases on a linear scale, then with cases
      on a log scale. Below that, the two individual projections for the outbreak within
      the LGAs of concern, and in the rest of NSW are shown, also on a linear and log
      scale each.

    <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer on trends</h3>
    <p>
      The plotted trendlines are simple extrapolations of what will happen if
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current value. This does not take into account
      that things are in a state of flux. As restrictions take effect, the virus should
      have fewer opportunities for spread, and <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> will decrease. If
      restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact tracing may suppress spread to a
      greater or lesser degree over time. The above plots specifically showing the effect
      of vaccines do take into account a reduction in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> as
      vaccination coverage increases, but ignore any other possible future changes in
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people each
      infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>
      to vary randomly in time. As such the projection should be taken with a grain of
      salt—it is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.
    </p> 

    <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

    <h4>Smoothing, calculating <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and projections</h4>

    <p>
      Daily case numbers have been smoothed with 4-day Gaussian smoothing:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>N</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
      (2<i>πT</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> /
      2<i>T</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>s</sub> = 4 days
      and ∗ is the convolution operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before smoothing, the daily case numbers are padded on the right with an
      extrapolation based on a exponential fit to the most recent 14 days of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is then calculated for each day as:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = (<i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) / <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>))<sup><i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> = 5 days is the approximate generation time of the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncertainty in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has contributions from the uncertainty
      in the above-mentioned exponential fit, as well as uncertainty in daily case
      numbers. The latter is considered to be Poisson noise scaled by a constant, chosen
      so as to make the reduced chi squared between raw and smoothed daily case numbers
      equal to 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extrapolation of daily case numbers is based on exponential growth/decay using
      the most recent value of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and its uncertainty range:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>extrap</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
      <sup>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i> - <i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)/<i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>

    <h4>Vaccination model</h4>
    <p>
      <span style="background-color: #FF00FF"><b>Note 2021-07-30</b></span>: I have
      changed the model used for the projections of the vaccine rollout to a stochastic
      SIR model, and the description below is out of date. I haven't yet documented the
      new model on this page, but the code can be seen <a
      href="https://github.com/chrisjbillington/chrisjbillington.github.io/blob/6451abd3623be9c571120d7e0e1a85b1fdde6242/nsw.py#L253">here</a>
      in the meantime. The projected outcomes with the new model are very similar to the
      old model, which was valid in the limit of infections only reaching a small
      fraction of the total population.
    </p>
    <p>
      To model vaccines taking effect after a delay, daily vaccine dose numbers
      <i>V</i>(<i>t</i>) are convolved with a Gaussian offset 1.5
      weeks in the future, with standard deviation 0.5 weeks:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>V</i><sub>effective</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>V</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
      (2<i>πσ</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-(<i>t</i> - <i>μ</i>)<sup>2</sup> /
      2<i>σ</i><sup>2</sup>)
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>μ</i> = 10.5 days, <i>σ</i> = 3.5 days, and ∗ is the convolution
      operation. This causes the effect of a vaccine dose to over the course of the
      second week after it is adminsitered, reaching nearly full effectiveness
      approximately two weeks after administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assume that one dose of any vaccine reduces spread by 40%, and two doses reduce
      spread by 80%. The proportion of the population susceptible to the virus is then:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>s</i>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = 1 - 0.4 × <i>D</i>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>D</i>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) is the cumulative number of doses per
      capita on each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is then estimated for any future date as:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) = 
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
      × <i>s</i>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) / <i>s</i>(t<sub>today</sub>)
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      And case numbers extrapolated from one day to the next, beginning with
      <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>), according to:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>extrap</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = <i>N</i><sub>extrap</sub>(<i>t<sub>i-1</sub></i>) <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)
      <sup>1/<i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
