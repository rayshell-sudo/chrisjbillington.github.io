    First two plots have case numbers on a linear scale, next two plots are exactly the
    same but with case numbers on a log scale.

    R_eff in LGAs of concern* vs the rest of NSW (*all of Penrith included):

    [LGAs of concern](https://chrisbillington.net/COVID_NSW_LGA_concern.png): R_eff =
    {R_eff_concern:.02f} Â± {u_R_eff_concern:.02f}

    [NSW excluding LGAs of
    concern](https://chrisbillington.net/COVID_NSW_LGA_others.png): R_eff =
    {R_eff_others:.02f} Â± {u_R_eff_others:.02f}

    [Hunter region](https://chrisbillington.net/COVID_hunter.png): R_eff =
    {R_eff_hunter:.02f} Â± {u_R_eff_hunter:.02f}

    Note: LGA/region-specific data is several days out of date compared to total
    numbers.

    Expected case numbers if the current  trend continues:

        {proj_lines}

    The current {"doubling" if doubling_time > 0 else "halving"} time is
    {abs(doubling_time):.01f} days.

    Usual disclaimer about trendlines:

    >The plotted trend is a simple extrapolation of what will happen if R_eff remains at
    >its current value. This does not take into account that things are in a state of
    >flux. As restrictions take effect, the virus should have fewer opportunities for
    >spread, and Reff will decrease. If restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact
    >tracing may suppress spread to a greater or lesser degree over time. The above plot
    >specifically showing the effect of vaccines does take into account a reduction in
    >R_eff as vaccination coverage increases, but ignores any other possible future
    >changes in R_eff.
    >
    >Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people each
    >infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of R_eff to vary randomly
    >in time. As such the projection should be taken with a grain of saltâ€”it is merely
    >an indication of the trend as it is right now.
