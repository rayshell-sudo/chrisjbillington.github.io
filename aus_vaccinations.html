    <h2 id="daily">Daily doses by administration channel</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a plot of 7-day average of daily vaccine doses administered in Australia
      by administration channel, showing the daily number of doses administered by state
      vaccination clinics, and by GPs and in federally operated aged and disability
      care. The 7-day average is further smoothed to remove day-to-day random
      fluctuations using Gaussian smoothing with Ïƒ=1 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projected doses are based on a fit to the last 4 weeks of first doses assuming
      exponential approach toward some maximum uptake level, the assumption that second
      doses will follow first-doses after the current average first-to-second dosing
      interval, and that third doses will follow after the current average
      second-to-third dosing interval.
    </p>
    <p>
     Data note 1: 80,560 GP-administered doses were reported on April 19th that were
     administered "prior to April 17". These have been incorporated into the data by
     spreading them over the period from March 22nd (start of phase 1b) to April 16th in
     proportion to the daily rate of GP-adminsitered doses on each day.
   </p>
   <p>
     Data note 2: A correction to of -9,260 doses to VIC's state-clinic numbers  was
     made on May 25th. These have been incorporated into the data by spreading them over
     the period from March 22nd (start of phase 1b) to April May 23rd in proportion to
     the daily rate of VIC state-clinic-adminsitered doses on each day.
   </p>

   <h2 id="weekday">Daily doses by weekday</h2>
   <p>
    Below is a plot of national daily doses by weekday, for the past five weeks. No
    averaging or smoothing has been done.
  </p>
  <img src="doses_by_weekday.svg">
  <h2 id="cumulative">Cumulative doses</h2>
  <p>
    Below is a simple plot of cumulative doses in Australia over time by
    administration channel, showing the cumulative number of doses administered by
    state vaccination clinics, and by GPs and in federally operated aged and
    disability care. Australia aims to vaccinate all eligible people with at
    least one dose by the end of 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following that is a plot of cumulative first, second, and third doses administered,
    with projections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Projected doses are based on a fit to the last 4 weeks of first doses assuming
    exponential approach toward some maximum uptake level, the assumption that second
    doses will follow first-doses after the current average first-to-second dosing
    interval, and that third doses will follow after the current average second-to-third
    dosing interval.
  </p>

  <img src="projection_cumulative_by_type.svg">
  <p>
  Note: The percentage targets in the above plot show the dates when 70% and 80% of the
  eligible population (ages 12+) received/are projected to have received two doses.
  However, in the national plan, these targets are framed in terms of the 16+
  population. Thus these projected dates assume that vaccination coverage in the 12â€“15
  age group is similar at these points to that of the 16+ age group.
  </p>


  <h2 id="agegroups">First and second dose coverage by age group</h2>
  <p>
    Below are plots of the percentage of each 10-year age group that has had a first and
    second administered, as well as the weekly rate of uptake as a percentage of each
    age group. Note that first dose data by age group is only available from May 9th,
    and second dose data from June 30th. The 12â€“15 and 16â€“19 age groups are kept
    separate rather than as a single 12â€“19 group, due to the 12â€“15 age group becoming
    eligible much later, making it more interesting to show as a separate group.
  </p>

  <img src="coverage_rate_by_agegroup.svg">
  <img src="coverage_2nd_rate_by_agegroup.svg">
  <h2 id="state">First and second dose coverage by state/territory</h2>
  <p>
    Below are plots of the percentage of the resident population aged 12+ in each
    state/territory that has had a first and second dose administered, as well as the
    weekly rate of uptake, as a percentage of each state/territory's age 12+ population.
    For a more detailed age breakdown, including 16+ coverage by state, see the next section.

  <h2 id="state-age">First and second dose coverage by state/territory and age group</h2>
  <p>
    Below are plots of the percentage of the resident population in each state and
    territory that has had a first and second dose administered, by age group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Included are also projections of when various targets would be met, assuming the
    current seven-day average rate of first-doses, and the current average dosing
    interval in each state. These should be taken with a grain of salt, as the rate of first-doses, as well as the dosing intervals, may change.

<!--   <h2 id="longproject">Longer-term projections</h2>
  <p>
    Below is a possible scenario for the vaccination program over the rest of the
    year.
  </p>
  <p>
      Projected doses are based on a fit to the last 3 weeks of first doses, assuming
      exponential decay toward some maximum uptake level, and the assumption that second
      doses will follow first-doses after the current average dosing interval.

  <p>
    Below is a plot of the estimated status of each vaccine dose in Australia. How many
    doses are in people's arms, in reserve, or available? This helps show whether
    administration of doses is keeping up with supply. Since the government has not
    published data to determine this exactly, this estimate is based on a number of
    assumptions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        That the number of Pfizer/Moderna and AstraZeneca first doses administered on a
        given day is in proportion to the number of available doses of each type of
        vaccine on that day, weighted by a "demand factor" equal to 2.0 for Pfizer and
        1.0 for AstraZeneca.
      </li>
      <li>
        That prior to May 27th, 50% of Pfizer supply is held in reserve for second
        doses, and after May 27th, that a Pfizer/Moderna reserve is maintained equal to
        40% of outstanding second doses. Pfizer/Moderna second doses are administered
        exactly 25 days after the first dose (Pfizer should be 21 days and Moderna 28m,
        but I'm treating them the same for simplicity),
      </li>
      <li>
        Prior to mid-April, that 50% of AstraZeneca supply is held in reserve for second
        doses. After mid-April (when the government became confident enough in local
        supply to maintain a smaller reserve), that a reserve is maintained with a
        number of doses equal top 66% of all outstanding second doses. AstraZeneca
        second doses are administered exactly 11 weeks after the first dose. (for most
        people, this is 12 weeks, but for some in areas with active outbreaks it is much
        earlier, so I'm using an intermediate value to approximate both situations)
      </li>
      <li>
        That doses becoming available in a given week (supply data is only available
        at the 1-week level) become available at the end of that week.
      </li>
      <li>
        That 12.5% of of AZ and 5% of Pfizer/Moderna doses are wasted (these are not shown in the utilisation plots).
      </li>
    </ul>

    Below is the same utilisation estimates as in the above plot, but separated by
    vaccine type: AstraZeneca vs Pfizer/Moderna (which are lumped together).
