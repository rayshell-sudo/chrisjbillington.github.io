    <h3 id="all"><i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> estimate from all cases</h3>

    <p>
      The Australian Capital Territory is currently experiencing an outbreak of COVID,
      due to the delta variant. Since August 12th, the Australian Capital Territory has
      been under lockdown restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      How have restrictions in the ACT affected the spread of the virus? The below
      plot shows how the effective reproduction number of the virus,
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has changed over time in the ACT, as well as how
      the daily cases have changed over time. A trendline shows the approximate
      trajectory daily case numbers would follow, were the reproduction number of the
      virus to remain at its current level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plot is shown twice, the first with cases on a linear scale, and the
      second on a log scale—the latter showing how consistently the caseload has
      followed exponential growth (which forms a straight line on a log scale).
    </p>

<!--     <h3 id="noniso"><i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> estimate from non-isolating cases only</h3>
    <p>
      Cases isolating during their infectious period represent a much lower risk of spread.
      The growth rate of non-isolating cases is a more leading indicator of whether
      Victoria is successfully suppressing the outbreak. The below plot is identical to the above
      one, except it excludes cases that were known to be isolating for their full infectious
      period.

    <h3 id="vax">Projected effect of vaccine rollout</h3>
    <p>
      The trendlines in the above plots simply project forward case numbers assuming that
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current estimated value. What about the effect
      of vaccines? Below is a plot with the projected trend taking into account an
      estimated reduction of spread due to vaccination levels increasing in the ACT
      through the remainder of the year. This projection is a stochastic SIR model,
      and thus also takes into account immunity due to infections, which would decrease
      transmission once a non-neglibible fraction of the population has been infected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of vaccination assumed in the model is 0.1 doses per 100 population per
      day, up to a maximum of 84% of the population.

      Note that the projected rollout rate has been adjusted over time to approximately
      match the speed of the rollout as it has changed over time.

      See below for plots of how these assumed rates compare to the vaccination rollout
      in the ACT so far. The vaccines are assumed to reduce <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> by
      40% per dose per capita—that is, overall spread is reduced by 40% for a
      partly-vaccinated individual and 80% for a fully vaccinated individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      This projection shows what might be possible if all other factors affecting
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>—such as restrictions—are held constant. If the ACT
      eases restrictions, however, then <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> will likely increase and
      the effect of vaccines in reducing spread will be delayed compared to this
      projection. On the other hand, if contact tracing is successful in decreasing
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>, case numbers may decline faster than this projection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plot is shown twice, the first with cases on a linear scale, and the
      second on a log scale.

      Below are plots of the vaccination rollout in the ACT to date, in terms of
      daily and cumulative doses per 100 population, with the assumed future rate used
      for the above projections also shown.

    <h3 id="animated">Animated projections over time</h3>

    How have the above projections changed over time? Below are animated versions of the
    above projection, one with cases on a linear scale, and one with cases on a log
    scale, run on old data to show how the projections have changed over time. Note that
    these are not 100% identical to the projections actually made on previous days, as
    there have been some slight methodology changes - but they should be very close.

    <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer on trends</h3>
    <p>
      The plotted trendlines are simple extrapolations of what will happen if
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current value. This does not take into account
      that things are in a state of flux. As restrictions take effect, the virus should
      have fewer opportunities for spread, and <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> will decrease. If
      restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact tracing may suppress spread to a
      greater or lesser degree over time. The above plots specifically showing the effect
      of vaccines do take into account a reduction in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> as
      vaccination coverage increases, but ignore any other possible future changes in
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people each
      infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>
      to vary randomly in time. As such the projection should be taken with a grain of
      salt—it is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.
    </p> 

  <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

  <h4>Padding, smoothing, and calculating <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub></h4>

  <p>
    Before calculating <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>, the daily case numbers are padded on the
    right and smoothed. A symmetric smoothing method is used, which is why padding on the
    right is necessary before smoothing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The padding is an extrapolation based on a fit to the most recent 14 days of the
    5-day moving average of daily case numbers <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>), with the following
    fit function:
  </p>
  <p>

    <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>A</i> exp[
    <i>k</i>(
    <i>t</i>-<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
    + 1/2 <i>k̇</i> (<i>t</i>-<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>
    )<sup>2</sup>
    ]

  </p>
  <p>
    where <i>A</i> and <i>k</i> are the fit parameters for the current daily caseload and
    exponential growth rate, and <i>k̇</i> is the current expected rate of change of the
    exponential growth rate due to vaccines:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>k̇</i> = 1 / 𝜏 (<i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) /
    <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>yesterday</sub>) - 1)
  </p>
  <p>
    where 𝜏 = 5 days is the approximate mean generation time of the virus, and
    <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) and
    <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>yesterday</sub>) are the fraction of the
    population not protected by vaccination from infection today and yesterday. See <a
    href="#vax-assumptions">vaccination assumptions</a> below for how
    <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i>) is calculated from vaccination numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    After padding, daily case numbers are smoothed with 4-day Gaussian smoothing:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
    (2𝜋<i>T</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> /
    2<i>T</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)
  </p>
  <p>
    where <i>T</i><sub>s</sub> = 4 days and ∗ is the convolution operation.
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is then calculated for each day as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) =
    (<i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) /
    <i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>))<sup>𝜏</sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The uncertainty in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has contributions from the uncertainty in
    the above-mentioned fit, as well as uncertainty in daily case numbers. The latter is
    considered to be Poisson noise scaled by a constant, chosen so as to make the reduced
    chi squared between raw and smoothed daily case numbers equal to 1.0.
  </p>

  <h4>Trend based on <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> only</h4>

  <p>
    The plot(s) with a simple extrapolation of daily case numbers, without taking into
    account the expected effects of vaccines, is exponential growth/decay using the most
    recent value of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and its uncertainty range:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>n</i><sub>extrap</sub> (<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) =
    <i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
    <sup>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i> - <i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) / 𝜏</sup>
  </p>

  <h4>Projected effect of vaccines</h4>
  <p>

    To project the effect of vaccines on the progression of daily cases in the future, I use
    a stochastic SIR model. The model is run 1000 times to project daily case numbers, and
    the median result and 68% range of outcomes shown in the projection.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each run of the model, a random value for each of
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) and
    <i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) is drawn from a multivariate
    normal distribution, using the mean values and covariance of the estimates of the two
    parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial infectious population is taken to be:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>i</i>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) =
    𝜏 <i>n</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial recovered population <i>r</i>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) is taken to be the
    cumulative number of cases so far in the outbreak, minus the currently infectious
    population.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each day, the fraction of the population susceptible to infection <i>s</i>(<i>t</i>) is
    taken to be
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>s</i>(<i>t</i>) = (1 - <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i>)) [1 - (<i>r</i>(<i>t</i>) +
    <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>)) / <i>N</i>]
  </p>
  <p>
    where <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t</i>) is the fraction of the population not protected
    from infection by vaccines (see See <a href="#vax-assumptions">below</a> for how this
    is calculated), and <i>N</i> is the total population.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming that <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is proportional to the susceptible fraction of
    the population, we can estimate what the reproduction number of the virus would be in
    the absence of any vaccines or immunity from infection:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>R</i><sub>naive</sub> = <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) /
    <i>s</i>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
  </p>
  <p>
    And compute an <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> for each future day based on the susceptible
    fraction of the population that day:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>s</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>R</i><sub>naive</sub>
  </p>
  <p>
    Each day of the model, the infectious population is increased by the number of new
    infections, and decreased by the number of new recoveries. The recovered population is
    increased by the number of new recoveries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of new infections each day is drawn from a Poission distribution with mean
    equal to <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i>) / 𝜏.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number of new recoveries each days is drawn from a binomial distribution with
    number of trials equal to the infectious population <i>i</i>(<i>t</i>), and with
    probability 1 / 𝜏.
  </p>
  <h4 id="vax-assumptions">Vaccination assumptions</h4>
  <p>
    To model vaccines taking effect after a delay, daily vaccine dose numbers
    <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) are convolved with a Gaussian function offset 1.5 weeks in the
    future, with standard deviation 0.5 weeks:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>v</i><sub>effective</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>v</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
    (2𝜋<i>σ</i><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-(<i>t</i> - <i>μ</i>)<sup>2</sup> /
    2<i>σ</i><sup>2</sup>)
  </p>
  <p>
    where <i>μ</i> = 10.5 days, <i>σ</i> = 3.5 days, and ∗ is the convolution
    operation. This causes the effect of a vaccine dose to over the course of the
    second week after it is adminsitered, reaching nearly full effectiveness
    approximately two weeks after administration.
  </p>
  <p>
    I assume that one dose of any vaccine reduces spread by 40%, and two doses reduce
    spread by 80%. The proportion of the population not protected by the vaccine against
    infection is then:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>s</i><sub>vax</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = 1 - 0.4 × <i>d</i>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)
  </p>
  <p>
    where <i>d</i>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) is the cumulative number of doses per
    capita on each day.
  </p>
