# Some changes in the projection.

# 1. +500k doses from Singapore. Thanks, Singapore! These have been added to supply
#    arriving by end of this week.

# 2. I found some doses under the couch pillows: The 500k COVAX doses from a few months
#    ago, I managed to accidentally misplace at some point. So I have added them back in.
#    Also, I typod a 1M doses projected Pfizer shipment in early September as only 100k
#    doses ðŸ˜¬. So I've bumped it back up to +1M. These two mistakes account for 1.4M doses.

# Apologies for the mistakes. After correcting these and adding the Singapore doses, the
# "dip" is all but gone. And the October spike is reduced, because at that point, we'll be
# running out of people to vaccinate.

FAQ:

Q. Why did the projections change?

A. These plots used to make projections based on expected supply, which was more
   accurate than extrapolating from current dose rates when the rollout was
   supply-limited. Now that the rollout is demand-limited, I've changed it to instead
   project future doses based on a fit of recent first-doses to an exponential function
   approaching some maximum level of uptake. Second doses are assumed to follow first
   doses after the average dosing interval (i.e. how many days ago the first dose
   coverage level was equal to the current second-dose coverage level).
