FAQ:

Q. Why did the projection for the phase C target date move back a few days?

A. I used to assume all supply would go to ages 16+ first. Now that we have to share
   with those pesky 12â€“15 year-olds (and now that I've updated my code to acknowledge
   this) there's less supply for the rest of us and it'll take a tad longer for us to
   reach any given threshold.

Q. How come in the "Projected cumulative 1st and 2nd doses" plot, the axis on the right
   is total eligible (12+) population, but the lines for the 70% and 80% thresholds are
   labelled "Phase B" and "Phase C", when these phases in the national plan refer to the
   16+ population?

A. This projection was originally made to project total doses based on available supply,
   and doesn't have any way of predicting which age group doses will go to first when
   they're all eligible. So I have simply marked the thresholds for the total eligible
   population. This will correspond well to the thresholds for the 16+ population only
   if ages 12â€“15 have similar coverage at those points in time to the rest of the
   population (uptake is very fast in the 12â€“15s right now, so maybe this isn't so
   unreasonable).

Q. What about hesitancy?

A. These projections completely ignore hesitancy, and represent what would be possible
   if everyone steps up for a dose when it's their turn. Without knowing what level of
   hesitancy there will be, I can't take it into account - so you should just mentally
   draw a horizontal line at whatever level of hesitancy you think there will be. For
   what it's worth, I am personally sceptical that anything like the 20% levels of
   hesitancy often cited will eventuate in Australia. Given Australia's past track
   record on vaccinations, I expect we'll end up one of the most highly vaccinated
   countries in the world against COVIDâ€”the lower takeup seen in many other
   countries is not indicative of what we can achieve here.
