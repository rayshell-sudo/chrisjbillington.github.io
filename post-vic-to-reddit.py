    First two plots have case numbers on a linear scale, next two plots are exactly the
    same but with case numbers on a log scale.

    First (and third) plot show an exponential trendline, second (and fourth) are SIR
    models that assume 27% of infections will be detected via testing.

    Expected case numbers if the current  trend continues:

        {proj_lines}

    The current {"doubling" if doubling_time > 0 else "halving"} time is
    {abs(doubling_time):.01f} days.

    Usual disclaimer about trendlines:

    > The plotted exponential trendlines in the above plots are simple extrapolations of
    > what will happen if Reff remains at its current value. the SIR model projection,
    > although it accounts for the effect of increasing immunity, still assumes that
    > Reff otherwise remains constant.
    > 
    > This does not take into account that things are in a state of flux. If
    > restrictions are tightened, the virus should have fewer opportunities for spread,
    > and Reff will decrease. If restrictions are eased, it may increase. Contact
    > tracing may suppress spread to a greater or lesser degree over time. The above
    > plots specifically showing the effect of population immunity do take into account
    > a reduction in Reff as immunity due to infections increases, but ignores any other
    > possible future changes in Reff.
    > 
    > Furthermore, when case numbers are small, the random chance of how many people
    > each infected person subsequently infects can cause estimates of Reff to vary
    > randomly in time. As such the projections should be taken with a grain of saltâ€”it
    > is merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.
